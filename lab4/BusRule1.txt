=============== BUSINESS RULE ===============

=============== RULE INFORMATION ===============
STATEMENT: Carpets sold in the store are NEVER sold at a loss (that is, sale_price < carpet_purchase_price) UNLESS
           that rug has been in the store's inventory for AT LEAST two years.
CONSTRAINT: When attempting to put in the price of a sale (sale_price) we must check the carpet_acq_date. If that date
            was greater than or equal to 2 years ago, the sale_price can be any valid number. If not, then the sale_price
            MUST be greater than or equal to the associated carpet_purchase_price in the Carpets table.
